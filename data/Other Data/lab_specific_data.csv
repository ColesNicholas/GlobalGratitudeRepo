She always looked forward to you coming to see her, and she thought the world of you.  You were the best friend she had in those years, besides me.  As a son, there is only so much she could talk about with me.  It was so important for her to have you as someone she could trust and talk to a couple of days a week.  You did the things that needed to be done for her, such as helping her bathe, cooking meals for her, doing her laundry.  You also helped me immensely as well.  As her only caregiver, who also worked 50+ hours per week, I was stretched to the limit physically, mentally and emotionally.  Simply knowing that you would be there at least twice a week for a few hours made my life a lot easier during those times.  I will be forever grateful of the positive impact you had on my mother's life, and I will never forget you.","","","","",4,4,"I don't know","I don't know",1,"Yes",1,2,2,"","No","USA_02c"

On Memorial Day, I find myself thinking a lot about you and your service in the Vietnam War. While I never got the chance to meet you, your bravery and sacrifice have left a lasting impression on our family.

Thank you for answering the call to serve your country. The Vietnam War was a difficult time, and I can't even begin to imagine the challenges you faced. It takes incredible courage to put yourself in harm's way for something bigger than yourself.

Your service has allowed generations of our family to live in freedom and peace. We are forever grateful for the role you played in shaping the world we live in today.

I wish I could hear stories about your experiences firsthand, about your time in Vietnam, and how it shaped you.  Even without those details, I know you must have carried a heavy burden.

We remember you with pride and respect. You are a hero in our family, and your memory will continue to inspire us.","","","","",4,4,"moral judgement for close people versus strangers","people are biased against their friends and or relatives compared to those they don't know",1,"sometimes",3,1,2,"more time efficient","","USA_02c"

I would like to thank you for being the loving, caring grandmother that you were to me.  Grandmother by kinship but mother in my heart.  You raised me with the best childhood any kid could ever dream of having.  I watched and payed attention as you fought for me tooth and nail to get custody of me back from the state.  I saw you raise yourself and me out of struggle and got us to an environment where we were free of financial hardship and most importantly free of worry.  I never once had to question if I would need any of the essentials as a child and more than that, I had a childhood of excess.  Along the way and throughout you taught me to be a hard worker and to appreciate everything and every opportunity that came my way.  It took me many years to realize a lot of that and to put it into action but I know it now.  If I could go back there would be many things I would do differently to make you proud because I know I let you down as I entered adulthood.  Man I took those times for granted back then.  I always told myself, ""You will have more time, you can get this done tomorrow.""  As we all know, there is no making up time and seizing the moments when they arrive is most important.  As I reminisce about all of the memories I have of you I would give anything just to be given the opportunity to have you read this.  You were so selfless when it came to me and I was everything to you.  You were everything to me and will always be.  I think of you everyday and all the time.  I sometimes feel lost here without your guidance but feel grounded when I think about how you did it alone back then.  I want to thank you maw maw.  I love you so much and thank you for loving me like you did.  There was no better person to walk this Earth than you.  I love you.

I hope you are doing well as I write this. Recently, as I've been thinking back on our friendship, I felt driven to reach out and thank you for your unflinching support during a difficult time in my life. Do you recall the difficult time I was going through following the loss of my mother? There are no words to describe how much your presence and empathy meant to me. You gave me your shoulder to cry on, listened to me without passing judgment, and comforted me when I most needed it. I will always treasure the times we spent together at that trying time because of your generosity and compassion, which got me through that difficult period. I want you to know how much your encouragement helped me on my road to recovery, and I will always be happy that I have you as a buddy. I appreciate your support throughout both good and difficult times.

Many thanks and feelings of love to you,

I didn't have to go anywhere so I sat on the couch and watched old episodes of the Rockford Files to be nostalgic. I then made a roast with vegetables for lunch and my dad came over to eat with me. He talked about what Memorial Day meant to him and he also talked about the friends he had lost in the Vietnam War. I think as my dad gets older that he realizes how much he has lost over time. After lunch, my dad and I watched a documentary about World War Two and my dad talked about how proud my grandfather was that he served in the Navy. This conversation filled my head with memories of my grandpa and it was nice because I hadn't thought about him for quite some time. After the documentary was over, my dad headed back home and I called my grandma and we talked about old times and about grandpa. This conversation made me sad, because at that point I realized how much I missed spending time with my grandparents at their old farm when I was a kid.

I'm grateful that you put the effort into organizing our Bible study in law school, because otherwise, I would have had far fewer close friends during that time. It's still kind of amazes me that at a time when we were all so stressed out and scared for our future, you had the presence of mind to think carefully about things like community and continuing our mutual growth.  

Thanks again, man.  You probably kept me from getting pretty depressed back then.  Seeing you be willing to accept burdens that could detract from your studies--and future job prospects--helped me understand what real strength is.
